## Adding to your project

Make sure you have one of the following repositories accessible:

```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
```

```groovy
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
```

```groovy
    repositories {
        maven {
            url  "http://dl.bintray.com/isupatches/Maven"
        }
    }
```

Then add it as a dependency (please see https://github.com/isuPatches/WiseFy/releases for the latest version):

For Gradle:

```groovy
    implementation 'com.isupatches:wisefy:<LATEST_VERSION>'
```

For Maven:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.isupatches</groupId>
      <artifactId>wisefy</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
```

You may also download the @aar from the <a href="https://github.com/isuPatches/WiseFy/releases" title="WiseFy Releases">releases page</a> and import it into your project manually. 

## Getting An Instance

WiseFy is constructed with the builder pattern that allows you access to the synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

*NOTE* The context passed in must be non-null.

To grab a default instance:

_With Kotlin_

```kotlin
val wisefy = WiseFy.Brains(activity!!).getSmarts()
```

_With Java_

```java
WiseFy wisefy = new WiseFy.Brains(getActivity()).getSmarts();
```

To grab an instance with logging enabled:

_With Kotlin_

```kotlin
val wisefy = WiseFy.Brains(activity!!).logging(true).getSmarts()
```

_With Java_

```java
WiseFy wisefy = new WiseFy.Brains(getActivity()).logging(true).getSmarts();
```

By default, legacy logic is disabled on devices with SDK 23 or higher.  If you want to use or test against the legacy search or connection logic, please see: [Using Legacy Classes And Logic](/documentation/using_legacy_classes_and_logic.md).

## Cleanup

Since the Async API of WiseFy is run on a background thread, it is necessary to make sure it is exited and cleanup up properly.

To stop the WiseFy thread and nullify it along with it's handler please call:

_With Kotlin_

```kotlin
wisefy.dump()
```

_With Java_

```java
wisefy.dump();
```

## Permissions

For the sake of transparency and because you're probably curious as to what permissions this library adds to your app, here are the additional expected permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

<strong> * NOTE * </strong>

If access points or SSIDs are not being returned on >= 6.x devices but there are visible networks, it's most likely because you haven't asked in your application for the `Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission which is what allows us to see the access points nearby. This permission request will not be added to the WiseFy library to reduce package bloat and so users can determine their own UI/UX.

Please check [the sample app](/wisefysample) for an example of how to request permissions for WiseFy.

## Usage

Please check [the documentation markdown directory](/documentation) for usage examples and details about both the synchronous and asynchronous API.
